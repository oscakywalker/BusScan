# BusScan: A Simulation Platform for Evaluating Bus Based On-street Parking Detection Strategies.
We have developed a simulating system of the micro-urban transportation system: BusScan. BusScan is an open-source simulation framework that models real-time parking detection through bus-mounted sensors while accounting for bus dynamics and driver behavior patterns. The main model could be seperated into three parts.
## 1. Bus Route Simulation
Using **Hough Transformation** together with customized city rule design modeling (boundary design, urban functional zoning, traffic configuration), users only need to upload a bus route map of the city they like to bulid models, and seperate the city into different regions with distinct characteristics. The codes are displayed in

# BusScan: A Simulation Platform for Evaluating Bus Based On-street Parking Detection Strategies.
We have developed a simulating system of the micro-urban transportation system: BusScan. BusScan is an open-source simulation framework that models real-time parking detection through bus-mounted sensors while accounting for bus dynamics and driver behavior patterns.
